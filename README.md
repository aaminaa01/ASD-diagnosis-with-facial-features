#  Diagnosing Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) with facial features
In this project, we investigate the potential of deep learning models in aiding the diagnosis of ASD through facial image analysis. Specifically, we conduct a comparative analysis of various image classification models, including VGG16, VGG19, ResNet18, ResNet34, and ResNet50, utilizing transfer learning techniques. Our experiments involve
fine-tuning these pre-trained models on a dataset comprising autistic and non-autistic facial images. We explore different hyperparameters and customization techniques to optimize the models for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score. Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique in enhancing the performance of ResNet models. Our results demonstrate promising outcomes, particularly with the ResNet50 model, which exhibits superior efficiency in ASD detection.
